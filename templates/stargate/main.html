                <p>The story of Stargate SG-1 begins over a year after the events of the feature film, when the United States government learns that a network of ancient alien devices called Stargates connects a vast multitude of planets within our Milky Way galaxy, facilitating near-instantaneous interstellar travel. Later episodes reveal that this network is capable of spanning not just planets within the Milky Way, but with sufficient power, can provide intergalactic travel as well.<br>
                <br>
                Stargate SG-1 chronicles the adventures of the elite special force Air Force squad, SG-1, the flagship team of over two dozen teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend Earth against alien threats. SG-1’s headquarters is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) underneath Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<br>
                <br>In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa'uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race from planet P3X-888 that takes humans as unwilling hosts.The Ori, a faction of the same race as the Ancients who instead use their powers to subjugate other species by religious indoctrination, assume the role of the main antagonists in Season 9 and Season 10.
